# Fees

The fee system for the protocol is based on static fee tiers. The tighter the liquidity range and the less liquid a given pair is, the bigger the fee revenue for providing said liquidity, and vice-versa. This means that for a given `Concentrated Liquidity Position` the closest/most accurate fee tier is attributed based on these two parameters. Fee tiers are expressed in `Basis Points` (e.g. 1 `Basis Point` represents 1/100 of 1%, or 0.01% of the used liquidity for a given swap)

### Current Fee Tiers

- 1 `Basis Point`
- 5 `Basis Points`
- 10 `Basis Points`
- 100 `Basis Points`
