# Fees

The fee system for the protocol is based on static fee tiers. The tighter the liquidity range and the less liquid a given pair is, the bigger the fee revenue for providing said liquidity, and vice-versa. This means that for a given `Concentrated Liquidity Position` the closest/most accurate fee tier is attributed based on these two parameters.
