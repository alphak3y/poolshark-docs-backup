# PredaDex Module

The PredaDex module gives users a way to perform a swap request though PredaDex, which is a full on-chain DEX aggregator, thus allowing users to set their own parameters for a swap on a list of community-selected DEXes. The cost of this method is greater than that of a normal user performing a swap with the DEX directly because there is an increased cost to perform the request on top of performing the swap call.

It is recommended for the average user to utilize either GroupSwap or the OrderBook module for increased reliability and gas-saving benefits. The gas costs will be slightly higher due to the Gelato execution fee of 10-15% plus the cost of making the request.
