# PredaDex Module

The PredaDex module gives users a way to perform a swap request though PredaDex, which is a full on-chain DEX aggregator, thus allowing users to set their own parameters for a swap on a list of dexes. The cost of this method is greater than that of a normal user performing a swap with the DEX directly, because there is an increased cost to perform the request, ontop of performing the swap call.
