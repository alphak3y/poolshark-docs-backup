># **What is Poolshark?**

The Poolshark Protocol is a peer-to-peer decentralized exchange which introduces efficient <em>price-time priority</em> into the world of decentralized exchanges.

It has elements of a traditional `Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker` (CFMM) such as Uniswap v3. Users will be able to have all the typical features they would usually expect along with ways to limit exposure to a single side.

<em>Features unique to Poolshark:</em>
```
> Directional LPing for single-sided risk
> Fungible Queues to capture fees on large trades
> Automated closing of liquidity positions
```

With these added features, liquidity providers can customize their risk profile to match the current price action in the market.

<em>Directional LPing</em> allows for one-way fills similar to a traditional limit order.

<em>Fungible Queues</em> allows market participants to capture a larger portion of trading fees.
