># **What is Poolshark?**

The Poolshark Protocol is a set of smart contracts which introduces **Directional Liquidity** into the world of decentralized exchanges.

It has elements of a traditional `Range AMM` (e.g. Uniswap v3), where LPs are free to choose a range in which to allocate their capital.

Liquidity Positions are then aggregated together into a single pool, forming a combined pool of capital for users to trade against.

With Directional Liquidity, users can trade their LP position in a single direction and protect against adverse price movements.

With these added features, liquidity providers can customize their risk profile to match the current price action in the market.

<em>Directional LPing</em> allows for one-way fills similar to a traditional limit order, whereas current LP positions will trade both ways.
