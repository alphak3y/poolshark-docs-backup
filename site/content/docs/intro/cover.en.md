### **What will be the launch strategy?**

Directional liquidity allows LPs to adopt a buy-and-hold strategy, which is statistically ideal for long-term investing.

#### Implementation Details

The protocol will be implemented as a set of non-upgradable smart contracts to enable full permissionless access and protect against censorship resistance.

The smart contract code for the protocol will be open-sourced upon completion of multiple internal and external audits as well as a public testnet launch.

#### Onboarding Customer Protocols

The focus initially will be on protocols which have:

    - Numerous derivative tokens 
    - Liquidity fragmentation issues
    - High volatility such as options tokens

Areas of focus:

    - Foreign exchange (USDC, EUROC, etc.)
    - Options protocols (Opyn, Dopex, Ribbon Finance, etc.)
    - Derivatives protocols (Tokenized yield)
    - Tokenized vaults (ERC-4626)
    - Sub-DAO governance tokens
