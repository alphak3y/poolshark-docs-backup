# Fungible Queues

Fungible queues are at the heart of the OceanBook protocol, providing a means of telling market makers when their order is filled based on how much volume has occurred at a specific price point.

Each queue will thereafter be referred to as a **Page**, which is a collection of orders all at the same price point.
