Let's imagine a 1L bottle of water which is marked every 100 mL.

* Alice has Mineral Water and wants Spring Water.

* Bob has Spring Water and wants Mineral Water.

* Both are willing to exchange 100 mL for 100 mL.

These steps must take place in the following order:

1. Alice puts the Mineral Water bottle from 0 mL to 100 mL.

2. Bob comes and takes the 100 mL of Mineral Water Alice placed.

3. At the same time, he will place his 100 mL of Spring Water in a second bottle.

4. Alice can then claim her 100 mL of Spring Water.

Alice is able to claim the output of her order fill since 100 mL of Spring Water was taken.

Since the exchange took place at a 1:1 rate, Alice will be able to claim 100 mL of Spring Water.

The smallest possible amount Bob can take will depend of the precision of our liquid measurements.

If that amount is 1 mL, there can be a maximum of 100 individual exchanges for Alice's 100 mL.

Each time the person taking Mineral Water will have to update how much was taken in total.

A bottle will hereafter be referred to as a `Page`, which is a collection of orders at the same price point.
